 *  Streams
 *  Streams are, simply speaking, collections of data.
 *  The difference between them and say, strings or arrays, is that when reading a stream you don't necessarily get all the data at once.
 *  Further, the (complete) data doesn't have to fit into memory. This is what makes streams so powerful. You can work with large amounts of data
 *  or data coming from an external source one chunk at a time.
 *
 *  Large data isn't the only benefit gained when working with streams though. They also give us some powerful options when it comes to composability.
 *  Just like when working in Bash, we can pipe streams into other streams or into other tools.
 *
 *  Many of the built-in Node Modules implement the streaming interface, including:
 *  Readable Streams ->                |  Writable Streams ->
 *  HTTP response, on the client       |  HTTP requests, on the client
 *  HTTP request, on the server        |  HTTP responses, on the server
 *  fs read streams                    |  fs write streams
 *  zlib streams                       |  zlib streams
 *  crypto streams                     |  crypto streams
 *  TCP sockets                        |  TCP sockets
 *  child process stdout * stderr      |  child process stdin
 *  process.stdin                      |  process.stdout, process.stderr
 *
 *  Some of these (like zlib & crypto) are both readable & writeable streams. Notice that the objects are also closely related.
 *  While an HTTP response is a readable stream on the client, itâ€™s a writable stream on the server.
 *  This is because in the HTTP case, we basically read from one object (http.IncomingMessage) and write to the other (http.ServerResponse).
 *  Also note how the stdio streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) have the inverse stream types when it comes to child processes.
 *  This allows for a really easy way to pipe to, and from, these child process stdio streams using the main process stdio streams.
 *  There are 5 kinds of streams:
 *  readable, writable, duplex, transform, and "classic"
 *
 *  Pipe
 *  All the different types of streams use `.pipe()` to pair inputs with outputs.
 *  'pipe()' is just a function that takes a readable stream `src` and hooks the output to a destination writable stream 'dst'
 *  Example:
 *  src.pipe(dst)
 *  .pipe(dst) returns `dst`, so you can chain multiple `.pipe()` together
 *  Example:
 *  a.pipe(b).pipe(c).pipe(d);
